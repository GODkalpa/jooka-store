# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a fully-functional e-commerce platform backend using Next.js, Supabase for authentication and database management, and NextAuth.js for session management. The platform will provide comprehensive admin and customer dashboards with secure authentication, role-based access control, and real-time features.
