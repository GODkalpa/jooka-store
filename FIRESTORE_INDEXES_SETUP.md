# Firestore Indexes Setup for Messaging System

## Required Indexes

To fix the messaging system 500 errors, you need to create these Firestore indexes:

### 1. Messages Collection Index

**Collection**: `messages`
**Fields**:
- `conversation_id` (Ascending)
- `created_at` (Ascending)

### 2. Conversations Collection Index

**Collection**: `conversations`  
**Fields**:
- `customer_id` (Ascending)
- `last_message_time` (Descending)

## How to Create Indexes

### Option 1: Firebase Console (Recommended)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Click on "Indexes" tab
5. Click "Create Index"
6. Add the above indexes one by one

### Option 2: Firebase CLI

If you have Firebase CLI configured:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### Option 3: Manual Index Creation URLs

When you see the error message in the console, Firebase will provide direct links to create the required indexes. Click those links to automatically set up the indexes.

## Expected Error Messages

You might see errors like:
- "The query requires an index"
- "Cloud Firestore index needed"

These are normal and expected until the indexes are created.

## After Index Creation

- Indexes can take a few minutes to build
- Once built, the messaging system will work without errors
- The 500 errors will be resolved

## Current Status

The messaging system is functional but requires these indexes for optimal performance. The fallback queries (without orderBy) will work but won't be as efficient.
